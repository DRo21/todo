# Todo List App - Win32 API

This project is a simple **Todo List App** built using the **Win32 API**. The application allows users to add tasks to a list, and each task can be checked off once completed. It is designed as a **testing ground** for exploring and experimenting with the Win32 API, specifically focusing on UI components like `ListView`, buttons, and text input.
